      "The aim of the project is to overhaul the project's front-end from AngularJS to Angular. The particularity is that we have no documentation on the endpoints, nor access to the back-end code. We had to do a lot of research and retroengineering to fully understand the usefulness of the routes. We also had to create a templator to reproduce the existing style of the applications. What's more, the back-end protocol is SOAP, with one particularity: the api systematically sends the entire table definition (separated by special characters) and then the data. We had to understand how this worked, and then create an in-house mini-framework to be able to interpret and make requests easily.",
